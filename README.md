# templogger

#templogger2020 file has all min mean and max for loggers since 2015 (lots of missing values) the other folders have raw data and our calcuated min mean max that needs to be added to the main file. Joe and I want to go out and collect all remaining loggers as they are full and not collecting anything currently, assuming we can find them after flooding. he word doc shows loccations of vistied sites and where we have put "fresh" loggers
